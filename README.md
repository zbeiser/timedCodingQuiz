# timedCodingQuiz

## Description
The objective of this project was to create a webpage application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript featuring an interactive quiz that tests the user's knowledge of coding concepts. The code uses a number of JavaScript concepts, such as using query selectors to hook into the DOM, local storage to store highscores, storing multiple objects within in an array, creating a timer, switching between elements by hiding and showing them with functions, and more.
